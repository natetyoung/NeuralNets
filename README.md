# NeuralNets
A simplistic implementation of a neural network without biases

The main thing this is able to train is XOR - it is untested otherwise.
The reason the package name is "No Longer Broken Neural Nets" is because I first built a neural network implementation like this quite a few years ago, and poured unreasonable quantities of time into neural nets that didn't work for a significant portion of my life.

As of September 2, 2016, <i>finally</i>, the neural net is <b>No Longer Broken.</b>
